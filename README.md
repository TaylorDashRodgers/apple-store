# Apple Store
We had trouble with displaying the images of the items. The path was stored in our database but it still wasn't showing the images on our application.
To fix this we had to use image addresses from online instead of using locally stored images and trying to access them through the local path because
that was not working. The most interesting part was storing the orders placed in our database. It was cool to see how the database could populate with 
an array of someones order after they placed it. In general it was just really cool to interact with our database. If we had more time we would have 
liked to add an admin page where we could view, edit, and delete all orders placed. This would be cool since we already save every order in our database 
and we could use that to add additional functionality. To conclude we were able to implement everything we pitched in the proposal. It would have been cool
to complete some extra things for an admin page but it was nice to see that we were able to complete the original project we pitched fully.
